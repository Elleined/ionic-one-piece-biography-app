						<strong>"Soul King" Brook</strong> is the musician of the Straw Hat Pirates, 
						one of their two swordsmen and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet.
						He is the ninth member of the crew and the eighth to join, doing so at the end of the Thriller Bark Arc.

						Fifty-two years ago, Brook was a part of Yorki's pirate crew, the Rumbar Pirates, 
						as one of the many musicians that comprised most of the crew. One day, while he and the 
						rest of the crew were still in the West Blue, their ship was followed by a baby whale who
						 had gotten lost. Seeing that the whale was really upset, Brook suggested to his captain
						  that they should play some music to cheer the whale up. Together with the rest of the 
						  crew, Brook played a beautiful song that worked.

						After three months of fixing their ship, Brook and the rest of the Rumbar Pirates decided 
						to leave Laboon under the care of Crocus. They promised Laboon then that they would come 
						back for the whale after going around the world. By then Laboon would've become very big
						 and thus they also promised to take Laboon along with them on their adventures.
